## Solidity Types

---

### Sized Types
- Purescript does not as of yet have type level naturals
- Luckily we don't need infinitely many

```haskell
module Network.Ethereum.Web3.Solidity.Size where

data D0 
... 
data D9
data (:&) :: Type -> Type -> Type
data Z :: Type
data S :: Type -> Type

class KnownSize s
class KnownNat n
class KnownSize n <= ByteSize n
class KnownSize n <= IntSize n

type N4 = S (S (S (S Z)))
```

---

### Sized Ints

- js doesn't have unbounded integers (doesn't even have integers!)
- need something like `BigNumber`

```haskell
newtype UIntN n = UIntN BigNumber

uIntNFromBigNumber :: forall n . KnownSize n 
                   => BigNumber 
                   -> Maybe (UIntN n)

type UInt = UIntN (D2 :& D5 :& D6)
```

---

### Length Indexed Vectors

```haskell
newtype Vector n a = Vector (Array a)

nilVector :: forall a . Vector Z a
nilVector = Vector mempty

vCons :: forall a n . a 
      -> Vector n a 
      -> Vector (S n) a
vCons a (Vector as) = Vector (a : as)

infixr 6 vCons as :<

toVector :: forall a n . KnownNat n 
         => Array a 
         -> Maybe (Vector n a)
toVector as = if natVal (Proxy :: Proxy n) /= A.length as
                 then Nothing
                 else Just (Vector as)

bools :: Vector N3 Boolean
bools = true :< false :< true :< nilVector
```

---

### Tuples
- The EVM is a stack based virtual machine with a maximum depth of 16. Limits the possible tuple sizes.

```haskell
data Tuple0 = Tuple0

newtype Tuple1 a = Tuple1 a

...

data Tuple16 a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p = 
  Tuple16 a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p

```
- First iteration of `purescript-web3` didn't handle these well.

---

## Basic (De)Serialization
- All basic Solidity types implement the following type classes for the ABI encoding schema.

```haskell
class ABIEncode a where
  toDataBuilder :: a -> HexString

class ABIDecode a where
  fromDataParser :: Parser String a
```

```haskell
instance abiEncodeUint :: IntSize n => ABIEncode (UIntN n) where
  toDataBuilder a = uInt256HexBuilder <<< unUIntN $ a

instance abiDecodeUint :: IntSize n => ABIDecode (UIntN n) where
  fromDataParser = do
    a <- uInt256HexParser
    maybe (fail $ msg a) pure <<< uIntNFromBigNumber $ a
  where
    msg n = let size = sizeVal (Proxy :: Proxy n)
            in "Couldn't parse as uint" <> show size <> ":" <> show n

```

---

## Tuples
- All Solidity functions accept and return tuples.
- Events are emitted as tuples, though not as straight forward to handle.
- Encoding and Decoding implemented "generically".

---

## Generics Primer (Advanced)
- All "basic" purescript types (i.e. of kind `Type`) admit a generic decomposition

```haskell
data Argument a = Argument a
data Product a b = Product a b
data Constructor (s :: Symbol) a = Constructor a

from (Tuple3 Bool String (UInt D8)) ::
  Constructor "Tuple3" (Product (Argument Bool) (Product (Argument String) (Argument UInt D8))) 
```

---

## Generics Primer (Advanced)
- Compiler implements generic decompositions for us, so we can use them for free.
- We can inductively build up generic types to have a certain property, such as `ABIEncode`

```haskell
instance genericEncodeBase :: ABIEncode a 
                           => GenericABIEncode (Argument a)

instance genericEncodeInductive :: ( ABIEncode a
                                   , GenericABIEncode b
                                   ) 
               => GenericABIEncode (Product (Argument a) b)
```

---

## Generics
- enables extremely local reasoning, building up more complicated expressions from smaller ones whose correctness is easier to prove.
- code utilizing "generics" is extremely reusable.

```haskell
genericEncode ::
  forall a rep .
     Generic a rep
  => GenericABIEncode rep
  => a
  -> HexString
genericABIEncode = genericToDataBuilder <<< from

```
---

## Web3 API
- The Web3 API is a set of RPC methods that the ethereum client knows about
- There are a lot, the type signatures serve as a sort of [documentation](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-web3/0.9.0/docs/Network.Ethereum.Web3.Api)

```haskell
eth_sendTransaction :: forall p e . IsAsyncProvider p 
                    => TransactionOptions 
                    -> Web3 p e HexString

eth_newFilter :: forall p e . IsAsyncProvider p 
              => Filter 
              -> Web3 p e FilterId

eth_getFilterChanges :: forall p e . IsAsyncProvider p 
                     => FilterId 
                     -> Web3 p e (Array Change)

...
```

---

## Web3 API
- Implementation of the client portion heavily inspired by the `hs-web3` implementation.
- How easy is it to add new endpoints as they are released?
```haskell
signMessage :: forall p e . IsAsyncProvider p
            => Address -- unlocked account
            -> HexString -- message to sign
            -> Web3 p e HexString -- signed message
```
[Pretty easy!](https://github.com/f-o-a-m/purescript-web3/blob/master/src/Network/Ethereum/Web3/Api.purs)

---

## User Interface
You will be able to use `purescript-web3` without knowing how it works. This means:

1. Calling contract methods, listening for events, querying blockchain metadata, full web3 api implementation.
2. Integrating with metamask.
3. Easily generate a simple client library for every contract.

---

## Generator - Simple Storage
Simple Storage allows us to change a `uint256`, query that state, and listen for updates to that state.

```javascript
contract SimpleStorage {
    uint public count;
    event CountSet(uint _count);
    function setCount(uint _count) {
        count = _count;
        CountSet(_count);
    }
}

```
---

## Generator - Simple Storage
Here is the client library generated which is generated from the ABI [^1]

```haskell
count :: forall e p . IsAsyncProvider p 
      => Address 
      -> Maybe Address 
      -> CallMode 
      -> Web3 p e (UIntN (D2 :& D5 :& D6))

setCount :: forall e p . IsAsyncProvider p 
         => Maybe Address 
         -> Address 
         -> UIntN (D2 :& D5 :& D6) 
         -> Web3 p e HexString

newtype CountSet = 
  CountSet { _count :: UIntN (D2 :& D5 :& D6) }
```
[^1]: There are a few other boiler plate type declarations that are generated, but this is pretty much it.

--- 

## Generator - Benefits
1. Reduce boiler plate.
2. You don't want to access the raw encoders/decoders manually when templating your transactions, laborious and potentially error prone.
3. The generator is meant to be run as an `npm build` step - any breaking changes to your contracts will cause compile time errors in your application. 
4. Specially generated types allow for higher levels of abstraction in library.

---

## Generator - How does it work
As an example, take a function call that generates a transaction:

```haskell
type SetCountFn = Tagged (SProxy "setCount(uint256)") (Tuple1 (UIntN (D2 :& D5 :& D6)))

setCount :: forall e p . IsAsyncProvider p 
         => Maybe Address 
         -> Address 
         -> UIntN (D2 :& D5 :& D6) 
         -> Web3 p e HexString
setCount x0 x1 x2 = sendTx x0 x1 noPay ((tagged $ Tuple1 x2) :: SetCountFn)
```

Notice the `noPay`

---

## Generator - How does it work
- All templated transaction functions are run with the `sendTx` method:

```haskell
class TxMethod (selector :: Symbol) a where
    sendTx :: forall p e u.
              IsAsyncProvider p
      => IsSymbol selector
      => EtherUnit u
      => Maybe Address              -- Contract address
      -> Address                    -- From address
      -> u                          -- paymentValue 
      -> Tagged (SProxy selector) a -- Method data
      -> Web3 p e HexString         -- 'Web3' wrapped tx hash
```
- `call` methods are similar, but with a return type

---

## Generator - Events
 - Events were difficult to find a good solution for due to the Ethereum log structure.
 - All events can be handled with the `event` method, which similarly defined in `hs-web3`

```haskell
event :: forall p e a i ni. IsAsyncProvider p
      => DecodeEvent i ni a
      => EventFilter a
      => Address
      -> (a -> ReaderT Change (Web3 p e) EventAction)
      -> Web3 p e (Fiber (eth :: ETH | e) Unit)

```
- this looks more complicated than it is.

---

## Events - Example
- Here's an example of the event monitor in the example app. It registers a handler and asynchronously polls a filter for the `CountSet` event, updating the React component's state.
- Since the return value of the handler is always `ContinueEvent`, this poll never terminates. 

```haskell
monitorCount :: R.ComponentDidMount CountStateProps CountState (eth :: ETH | eff)
monitorCount this = void $ do
  props <- R.getProps this
  launchAff do
    void $ runWeb3 metamask $
      event config.simpleStorageAddress $ \(SimpleStorage.CountSet cs) -> do
      _ <- liftEff <<< R.transformState this $ _{currentCount= show cs._count}
      pure ContinueEvent
```
